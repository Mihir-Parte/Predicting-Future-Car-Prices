# Data-Science-and-Visualization-Project
Car Salesâ€™ Price Prediction

To learn and improve my data science skills, I took up this project by deciding on a problem statement. 
I finalized my problem statement after looking through Kaggle's datasets. 

Dataset chosen: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/CooperUnion/cardataset?datasetId=575

Problem Statement: 
"In the world of business, it is important to know which products are profitable for the company 
or distributor and which products are leading to a loss, which features of the product attract the 
customer more or which features dissuade them from purchasing the product. To learn the best 
and worst features of a product, it is important to analyse their performances over a period of 
time to make a conclusion about the product.
Analyse trends in car sales and predict future car prices (MSRP) using different car features 
as parameters for prediction."
